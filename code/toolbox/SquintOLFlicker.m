function [keyEvents, t, counter] = SquintOLFlicker(ol, block, trial, frameDurationSecs, numIterations)
%%TrialSequenceMROLFlicker  Flickers the OneLight for MR experiments.
%
% This is the function that sends the starts and stops to the OL
%
% Syntax:
% keyPress = ModulationTrialSequenceFlickerStartsStops(trial, frameDurationSecs, numIterations)
%
% Description:
% Flickers the OneLight using the passed stops matrix until a key is
% pressed or the number of iterations is reached.
%
% Input:
% ol (OneLight) - The OneLight object. 
% stops (1024xN) - The normalized [0,1] mirror stops to loop through.
% frameDurationSecs (scalar) - The duration to hold each setting until the
%     next one is loaded.
% numIterations (scalar) - The number of iterations to loop through the
%     stops.  Passing Inf causes the function to loop forever.
%
% Output:
% keyPress (char|empty) - If in continuous mode, the key the user pressed
%     to end the script.  In regular mode, this will always be empty.

% Counters to keep track of which of the stops to display and which
% iteration we're on.

% This is the time of the stops change.  It gets updated everytime
% we apply new mirror stops.

        mileStone = mileStone + frameDurationSecs;
        
        % Update our stops counter.
        setCount = mod(setCount + 1, numstops);
        
        % If we've reached the end of the stops list, iterate the
        % counter that keeps track of how many times we've gone through
        % the list.
        if setCount == 0
            iterationCount = iterationCount + 1;
